The focal method is `${method_sig}` in the focal class `${class_name}`, and their information is
```${full_fm}```.
<#if other_method_sigs?has_content>
    Signatures of Other methods in the focal class are `${other_method_sigs}`.
</#if>
<#list c_deps?keys as key>
    The brief information of dependent class `${key}` is
```${c_deps[key]}```.
</#list>
<#list m_deps?keys as key>
    The brief information of dependent class `${key}` is
    ```${m_deps[key]}```.

You should follow these steps to generate the test, starting each step with the word ${'<INFO>'}:
    1. List all necessary dependencies.
    2. Think step by step, describe how to prepare all necessary classes and methods for invoking the focal method.
    3. Write a complete test class with imports, ensuring to cover all branches and lines in the test.
    4. Review your code to ensure all statements are implemented and free from bugs. Provide a revised version if modifications are made during the review.
    e.g., "${'<INFO>'} First, import the following dependencies...".
