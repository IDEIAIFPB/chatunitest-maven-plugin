Please help me generate a whole JUnit test for a focal method in a focal class.
I will provide the following information:
1. The focal class signature.
2. Source code of the focal method.
3. Signatures of other methods and fields in the class.
I need you to create a unit test case using JUnit 5, ensuring optimal branch and line coverage. Compile without errors, and use reflection to invoke private methods. No additional explanations required.
